### What is React?
* React is a JavaScript library
* Its ultimate purpose is to show content (HTML) to users and handle user interaction
* React can work by itself, but can also work with a great variety of other packages, libraries, servers and databases
* React COMPONENTS are made using either JavaScript CLASSES or FUNCTIONS
  ```
  class App extends React.Component {
